<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Introduction"> </a></h2><p>Consider the two-layer "leaky greenhouse" (or grey radiation) model from <a href="https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/courseware/elementary-greenhouse.html">these lecture notes</a>.</p>
<p>Here you will use this model to investigate the <strong>radiative effects of clouds</strong>.</p>
<p>Clouds simultaneously <strong>reflect shortwave radiation</strong> and <strong>absorb longwave radiation</strong>. These two effects often oppose each other in nature, and which one is stronger depends (among other things) on whether the clouds are <strong>low</strong> or <strong>high</strong> (i.e. in layer 0 or layer 1).</p>
<p>For this question we will suppose (as we did in the lecture notes) that there is <strong>no absorption of shortwave radiation</strong> in the atmosphere.</p>

<h2 id="Question-1">Question 1<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-1"> </a></h2><p>Suppose a cloud reflects a fraction $\alpha_c$ of the shortwave beam incoming from above. $\alpha_c$ is a number between 0 and 1. Provide a coherent argument (in words, sketches, and/or equations) for why the <strong>shortwave</strong> effects cloud should alway be a <strong>cooling</strong> on the surface. Is this cooling effect different if the cloud is low or high? Explain.</p>

<h2 id="Question-2">Question 2<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-2"> </a></h2><p>Because the liquid water droplets in a cloud are effective absorbers of longwave radiation, a cloud will <strong>increase the longwave absorptivity / emissivity</strong> of the layer in which it resides.</p>
<p>We can represent this in the two-layer atmosphere by letting the absorptivity of a cloudy layer be $\epsilon + \epsilon_c$, where $\epsilon_c$ is an additional absorptivity due to the cloud. Derive a formula (i.e. an algebraic expression) for the OLR in terms of the temperatures $T_s, T_0, T_1$ and the emissivities $\epsilon, \epsilon_c$ for two different cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>a low cloud (the additional $\epsilon_c$ is in layer 0)</li>
<li>a high cloud (the additional $\epsilon_c$ is in layer 1)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Question-3">Question 3<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-3"> </a></h2><p>Now use the tuned numerical values we used in class:</p>
<ul>
<li>$T_s = 288$ K</li>
<li>$T_0 = 275$ K</li>
<li>$T_1 = 230$ K</li>
<li>$\epsilon = 0.586$</li>
</ul>
<p>and take $\epsilon_c = 0.2$</p>
<p>(a) Repeat the following for both a high cloud and a low cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate the <strong>difference in OLR</strong> due to the presence of the cloud, compared to the case with no cloud. </li>
<li>Does this represent a warming or cooling effect?</li>
</ul>
<p>(b) Which one has a larger effect, the low cloud or the high cloud?</p>
